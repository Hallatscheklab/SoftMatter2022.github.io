    "To describe the depletion interaction between two spheres (radius $R$) in a solution of smaller spheres (radius $σ/2$), we may use the same approach of assuming an isotropic osmotic pressure of the smaller spheres.\n",
    "The smaller spheres can actually not approach a spherical shell of thickness $σ/2$ around the larger spheres or a total volume of $4π(R+σ/2)^3/3$ . The pressure on the large spheres has no consequences except in the case where the two spheres approach closer than $r≤2(R+σ/2)=2R_d$. In this case the two excluded volumes around each sphere overlap to a lens-like volume. Due to this overall, the forces which create the pressure on the spherical surface up to an angle $θ_0$ are unbalanced from the other side of the surface (see image) and result in an attractive interaction.\n",
