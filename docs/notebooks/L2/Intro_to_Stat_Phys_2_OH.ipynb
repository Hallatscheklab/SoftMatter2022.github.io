    "Usually there is a pronounced tradeoff between the two factors appearing in this equation. As the system energy increases, we gain a lot of new system states ($\\Omega_s$ rises exponentially or faster with $E_s$). But with increasing system energy, we also loose increasingly loose bath states, in fact at an exponential rate precisely given by the Boltzmann factor. The result is a pronounced peak of the product of both factors at a particular energy $U$. This typical situation is depicted below."
