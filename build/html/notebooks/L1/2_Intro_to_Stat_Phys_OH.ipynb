We will usually assume that both types of measurements give the same results in the thermodynamic limit (long times and large ensembles). This is called the *ergodicity* assumption. The breaking of ergodicity is topic of active research. Ergodicity is broken in certain models of glasses it is broken, reflecting the long relaxation times in these systems."
