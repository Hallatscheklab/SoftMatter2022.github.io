    "So far we have considered either isolated systems, meaning that no energy nor particle exchange is possible, and closed systems, which allow an exchange of energy with a reservoir (bath). We will now have a look at a system that also allows an exchange of particles with a reservoir. For these systems, we will define the **chemical potential** $\\mu$ which we will identify as the **free energy change when adding one molecule of a given species to a thermodynamic system** at constant $p$ and $T$.\n",
