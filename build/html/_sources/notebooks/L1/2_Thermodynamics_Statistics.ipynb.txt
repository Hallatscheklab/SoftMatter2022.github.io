It is a *closed system* if it can exchange energy with the surrounding, i.e. a heat bath keeping it at a constant temperature. In case the system can exchange also particles, it is called an *open system*. A thermodynamic system can be defined by **state variables** $p$, $V$ and/or $T$. **State functions** are useful to formulate the laws of thermodynamics. A state function is independent of how one arrived at that particular state. They are most often used to characterize an equilibrium state.\n",
